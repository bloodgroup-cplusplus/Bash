#!/bin/bash

# we should always introduce commenting scripts early in the piece. 
# A script coment is prefaced with a # symbol . 
#Anything after the #symbol is a comment and is not evaluated
#by the script. 
#the shebang, #!/bin/bash, is primarily a comment and, as such, is not 
#evaluated by the shell. The shell running the script reads the whole
#shebang, so it knows
# which command interpreter to hand the script over to. 
# a comment may be at the start of a line or a partway into the line. 
# Shell scriptiing does not have the notion of multi-line comments
#Welcome to bash scripting
